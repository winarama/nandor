Nandor is a relentless utility application that blocks IP addresses of would-be marauders who threaten the borders of your digital kingdom. Nandor has two modes of operation, **geoblock** and **logscan**.

## geoblock
geoblock blocks all IP addresses associated with a given country.<br>  
`nandor geoblock <counrty-code-list>`<br>  
`Example: nandor geoblock af cn ru`

## logscan
logscan scans service logs for script-kiddie requests and blocks associated IP addresses.<br>  
`nandor <service-name>`<br>  
`Example: nandor coolio`
